                        <p>Prime rib, also referred to as standing rib roast, is a beautiful piece of meat. Whenever we need a truly show-stopping holiday roast, we turn to it. A well-cooked prime rib is juicy, full of flavor, and not at all difficult to make. Plus, it's impressive: You'll make your guests think you labored for hours, but it'll be your little secret that it was no sweat and really your oven did all the work.</p>

                                <li> 1 standing rib roast (about 1/2 pound per person)</li>
                                <li> 1 tbsp. kosher sal </li>
                                <li> 2 tsp. black pepper</li>
                                <li> Freshly ground black pepper </li>
                                <li> 1 bunch fresh rosemary</li>

                    <div>
                        <p>Adding sweet potatoes to your diet is an easy and delicious habit to pick up when you're trying to eat healthyâ€”the vegetable is a total superfood, packed with vitamin C and fiber. They're also totally versatile but baking them whole in the oven is arguably the simplest way to prepare them, and they will be the perfect base for all types of toppings. We love them stuffed with barbecue chicken or as a bunless sloppy joe. </p>

                                <li> Kosher salt</li>

                        <p>Reminiscent of countertop service and carhop days, there is nothing better than a perfect milkshake. Luckily, making one at home is extremely easy. This easy milkshake recipe gives you the perfect ratio of milk to ice cream and is completely customizable! </p>
